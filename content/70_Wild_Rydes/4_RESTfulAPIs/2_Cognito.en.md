### 2. Create a Cognito User Pools Authorizer

#### Background
Amazon API Gateway can use the JWT tokens returned by Cognito User Pools to authenticate API calls. In this step you'll configure an authorizer for your API to use the user pool you created in [User Management][user-management].

#### High-Level Instructions
In the Amazon API Gateway console, create a new Cognito user pool authorizer for your API. Configure it with the details of the user pool that you created in the previous module. You can test the configuration in the console by copying and pasting the auth token presented to you after you log in via the /signin.html page of your current website.

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-step directions**

1. Under your newly created API, choose **Authorizers**.
1. Choose **Create New Authorizer**.
1. Enter `WildRydes` for the Authorizer name.
1. Select **Cognito** for the type.
1. In the Region drop-down under **Cognito User Pool**, select the Region where you created your Cognito user pool in the User Management module (by default the current region should be selected).
1. Enter `WildRydes` (or the name you gave your user pool) in the **Cognito User Pool** input.
1. Enter `Authorization` for the **Token Source**.
1. Choose **Create**.

1. Go back to previous tab where you have just finished creating the Authorizer
1. Click **Test** at the bottom of the card for the authorizer.

### 4. Create a new user for your user pool

**Note:** Instead of having you write the browser-side code for managing the registration, verification, and sign in flows, we provide a working implementation in the assets you deployed in the first module by using the AWS Amplify [Authentication UI compenent](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/authentication).  

The Authenticator component provides basic login/logout functionality for an application, as well confirmation steps for new user registration and user login.

Usage: `<amplify-authenticator></amplify-authenticator>`

## Implementation Validation

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-step directions**

1. Visit `/auth` under your website domain, or choose the **Giddy Up!** button on the homepage of your site.

1. Click on the **Create Account** link at the bottom of the sign in box.

1. Complete the registration form and choose **Create Account**. You can use your own email or enter a fake email. Make sure to choose a password that contains at least one upper-case letter, a number, and a special character. Don't forget the password you entered for later. You should see an alert that confirms that your user has been created.

**:warning:**
If you get an ` Authentication Error  ` this is likely because your changes have not finished deploying.

1. Confirm your new user using one of the two following methods.

  1. If you used an email address you control, you can complete the account verification process by entering the verification code that is emailed to you. Please note, the verification email may end up in your spam folder. For real deployments we recommend [configuring your user pool to use Amazon Simple Email Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-message-customizations.html#cognito-user-pool-settings-ses-authorization-to-send-email) to send emails from a domain you own.

1. If you used a dummy email address, you must confirm the user manually through the Cognito console.

    1. From the AWS console, click Services then select **Cognito** under Security, Identity & Compliance.
    1. Choose **Manage your User Pools**
    1. Select the `WildRydes` user pool and click **Users and groups** in the left navigation bar.
    1. You should see a user corresponding to the email address that you submitted through the registration page. Choose that username to view the user detail page.
    1. Choose **Confirm user** to finalize the account creation process.

1. After confirming the new user using either the verrification code or the Cognito console, click on the **back to sign in** link or refresh the **/auth** page and log in using the email address and password you entered during the registration step.

1. If successful you should be redirected to `/ride`. You should see a notification that the API is not configured.

### :star: Recap

:key: [AWS Lambda][lambda] is a serverless functions as a service product that removes the burden of managing servers to run your applications. You configure a trigger and set the role that the function can use and then can interface with almost anything you want from databases, to datastores, to other services eithe publicly on the internet or in your own Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). [Amazon DynamoDB][dynamodb] is a non-relational serverless database that can scale automatically to handle massive amounts of traffic and data without you need manage any servers.

:wrench: In this module you've created a DynamoDB table and then a Lambda function to write data into it. This function will be put behind an Amazon API Gateway in the next module which will in turn be connected to your web application to capture the ride details from your users.

### Next

:white_check_mark: After you have successfully tested your new function using the Lambda console, you can move on to the next module, [RESTful APIs][restful-apis].

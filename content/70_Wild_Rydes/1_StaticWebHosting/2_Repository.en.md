### 2. Create the git repository

We will use [AWS CodeCommit][codecommit] to host your site's repository. CodeCommit is included in the [AWS Free Tier][codecommit-free-tier].

#### Using CodeCommit
The AWS Cloud9 development environment comes with AWS managed temporary credentials that are associated with your IAM user. You use these credentials with the AWS [git-remote-codecommit][git-remote-codecommit] tool (A Git Remote Helper that makes it easier to interact with AWS CodeCommit). Install the tool by running the following command in the terminal of your Cloud9 environment.

```bash
sudo pip install git-remote-codecommit
```
Next you need to create the repository and clone it to your Cloud9 environment:

```bash
aws codecommit create-repository \
  --repository-name wild-rydes
```

1.  Clone the template repository using `git clone --bare`.
    ```
    git clone --bare https://github.com/bls20AWS/wildRydesVue.git
    ```
1. `push --mirror` to your new repository.
    ```
    cd wildRydesVue.git
    git push --mirror codecommit://wild-rydes
    ```
1. Remove the temporary local repository you created in step2
    ```
    cd ..
    rm -rf wildRydesVue.git
    ```
1.  Clone the new repository to your Development environment
    ```
    git clone codecommit://wild-rydes
    ```
1.  Make sure you're on the `master` branch
    ```
    aws codecommit update-default-branch \
    --repository-name wild-rydes \
    --default-branch-name master

    cd wild-rydes
    git checkout master
    ```
